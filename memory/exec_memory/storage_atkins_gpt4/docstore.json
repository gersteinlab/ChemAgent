The number of moles (n) of H2 is 3.0 mol and of N2 is 1.0 mol. The temperature (T) is 25\u00b0C or 298.15 K. The ideal gas constant (R) is 0.0821 L\u00b7atm/(K\u00b7mol). The volume (V) of the container is not given, but since both gases are in the same container, we can assume that the volume is the same for both gases.\n\n[step 2] Use the ideal gas law to calculate the pressure contributed by each gas. The pressure (P) is calculated by rearranging the ideal gas law to P = nRT/V. Since the volume is the same for both gases, it will cancel out when we add the pressures together.\n\n[step 3] Calculate the pressure for H2.\nP(H2) = n(H2)RT/V = 3.0 mol * 0.0821 L\u00b7atm/(K\u00b7mol) * 298.15 K / V\n\n[step 4] Calculate the pressure for N2.\nP(N2) = n(N2)RT/V = 1.0 mol * 0.0821 L\u00b7atm/(K\u00b7mol) * 298.15 K / V\n\n[step 5] Apply Dalton\u2019s Law of partial pressures to find the partial pressure of each gas.

The derivation involves integrating the distribution function over all possible speeds, taking into account the fact that the speed can never be negative.\n- The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution law itself is derived from statistical mechanics, considering the momentum and kinetic energy of the molecules.\n\n[step 3] Understand the relationship between the variables:\n- The mean speed of the molecules is directly proportional to the square root of the temperature and inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the molecules. This means that as the temperature increases, the mean speed also increases, and as the mass of the molecules increases, the mean speed decreases.\n\n**Answer conclusion:**\n[answer]: ```python\n# No calculation needed for this subtask\nprint(\"The formula for the mean speed of a molecule has been understood, including its derivation and the relationship between the variables.\")\n```", "reflex": "['When planning for subsequent tasks, it will be helpful to define the problem well and flesh out all necessary steps required to reach the goal.', 'Interpreting and understanding the meaning and derivation of mathematical formulae should be included in the planning stage for tasks that involve complex theories.']", "pool": 418103, "tree_id": "1f8a0bec04d342fcbea008a73b675f11", "task_id": "1.1", "level": 0, "status": "SUCCESS"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "Understand the formula for mean speed ($\\bar{c}$) of a molecule and recognize it comes from statistical mechanics through Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution law.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f8a0bec04d342fcbea008a73b675f11-1.2": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f8a0bec04d342fcbea008a73b675f11-1.2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"goal": "Apply the mean speed formula to the given conditions, where the molecule is $\\mathrm{N}_2$ and the temperature is $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.", "action": "**Formulae retrieval: **\n[Formula 1] The formula for mean speed of a molecule is given by:\n\\[ \\bar{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8kT}{\\pi m}} \\]\nwhere:\n- \\( \\bar{c} \\) is the mean speed,\n- \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant,\n- \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature in Kelvin,\n- \\( m \\) is the mass of the molecule.\n\n**Reasoning/calculation process:**\n[step 1] Convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin.
