'summary': "The task required to calculate the volume occupied by a gas under certain conditions given its compression factor. The problem was approached using two sub-tasks. The first sub-task involved employing the ideal gas law and the definition of the compression factor to find out the volume occupied by the given amount of gas under the provided conditions. In doing so, it was necessary to convert the gas amount from millimoles to moles and to perform other necessary unit changes. The ideal gas law formula 'PV = nRT' and the compression factor definition 'Z = V(real)/V(ideal)' were used to derive volume of real gas as 'V(real) = Z * nRT/P'. In the next sub-task, the obtained volume in liters was converted into cubic centimeters using the conversion factor of 1 L = 1000 cm³."

[ACTION]: **Formulae retrieval: **
[Formula 1] Ideal Gas Law: PV = nRT
[Formula 2] Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures: P_total = P1 + P2 + ... + Pn

**Reasoning/calculation process:**
[step 1] Identify the given values. The number of moles (n) of H2 is 3.0 mol and of N2 is 1.0 mol. The temperature (T) is 25°C or 298.15 K. The ideal gas constant (R) is 0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol). The volume (V) of the container is not given, but since both gases are in the same container, we can assume that the volume is the same for both gases.

[step 2] Use the ideal gas law to calculate the pressure contributed by each gas. The pressure (P) is calculated by rearranging the ideal gas law to P = nRT/V. Since the volume is the same for both gases, it will cancel out when we add the pressures together.

[step 3] Calculate the pressure for H2.
P(H2) = n(H2)RT/V = 3.0 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol) * 298.15 K / V

[step 4] Calculate the pressure for N2.
P(N2) = n(N2)RT/V = 1.0 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/(K·mol) * 298.15 K / V

[step 5] Apply Dalton’s Law of partial pressures to find the partial pressure of each gas. The partial pressure of a gas is the pressure that the gas would exert if it alone occupied the volume of the mixture. Therefore, the partial pressure of each gas is equal to its pressure calculated in steps 3 and 4.

- \( n \) is the number of moles,
- \( \mu \) is the chemical potential,

- \( R \) is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K),

\[ G_{H2} = 0 J \]

For N2(g):
\[ G_{N2} = 1.0 mol * (0 J/mol + 0 J/mol) \]
